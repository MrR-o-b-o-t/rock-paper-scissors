# Vanilla Javascript Rock Paper Scissors Game

<br>

_A Rock Paper Scissors game that allows a user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then the JavaScript function also randomly makes a selection.
After the choices are compared and the winner displayed to the screen._

## Summary

As I continue to work on a deeper understanding of JavaScript I have put together another app using pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. 
These apps are all built without any tutorials, only occasional guidance from mentors and colleagues on very specific tasks when needed. This gives me the oppurtunity
to really dive into what is going on behind the scenes and gain a better understanding of JavaScript as a whole. 
This game takes a user input by collecting the id of a clicked image, compares that to a randomly generated choice, and then displays the
results to the screen. The user can play as many times as he/she likes. Give it a try above! I will warn you though, JavaScript plays a mean
game of Rock Paper Scissors!
